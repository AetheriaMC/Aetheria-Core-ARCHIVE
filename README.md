I decided to make this public and archive because this core is terrible, a lot of copy pasted code and a nightmare of java naming convention "violations" <br>
Ever since I created OctoPvP's octocore, every time I look at this core, I just want to puke<br>
Aetheria is now using a custom AetheriaCore based off OctoCore<br>
Feel free to copy the code from this but beware! It is riddled with bugs and errors<br>
I will not provide support for this.
